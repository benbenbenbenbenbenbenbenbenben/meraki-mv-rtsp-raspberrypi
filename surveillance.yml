#THIS IS A YAML FILE, INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT. ALSO DO NOT USE TABS FOR INDENTATION, BUT USE SPACES
#THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES WITH ALL OPTIONS EXPLAINED, REMOVE OR ADAPT THEM WITH YOUR REAL CONFIG

essentials:

  screens:
      #Start config for example screen one, this is the minimal config. This will show a 2x2 if all streams are connectable,
      #otherwise rpisurv, by default, rearranges the screen to only show the connectable streams. To disable the latter set disable_probing_for_all_streams=True
      #Force this screen to be shown by pressing and holding F1 or keypad 0
    - camera_streams:
        - url: "rtsp://192.168.0.127:9000/live"
        - url: "rtsp://192.168.0.144:9000/live"
        - url: "https://images.rpisurv.net/example.png"
          imageurl: true
        - url: "https://images.rpisurv.net/example.png"
          imageurl: true
         #To specify this url is not a camera stream but an image stream please set imageurl to true for this url

      #Autostretching makes sures all of your pixels will be uses to display streams, so you have a maximum surveillance area.
      #But this will probably destroy the aspect ratio of your last stream.
      #Defaults to False
      autostretch: False

      #This is how long this screen will be shown each rotation.
      #If this is set to a very low value then it can happen that building up the active and/or the cached screen takes longer then this duration,
      #in that case the building and caching needs to finish first before timer will be expired and next screen is shown
      #Defaults to 20
      duration: 60

#These are fallbacks if autodetection fails;
#Normally you do not need to configure these
